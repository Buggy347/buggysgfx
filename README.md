# GFX made by Buggy347
Free GFX for HOI4
-----------------
Use these focus icons in your mods, they have been made all by me.
Download these and put them into the game as you would put in your own gfx. Google it if you need help.
If you would like to credit me cool, if not no biggie.

WARNING: The .dds files I have might not work because .dds files are annoying. If they don't work, download the png and convert it to dds a way that works for you.
